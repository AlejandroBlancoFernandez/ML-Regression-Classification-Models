# Machine Learning University Projects

This repository contains two machine learning projects developed for the Machine Learning course at UC3M. The projects focus on regression and classification problems, respectively, and include various machine learning algorithms.

The main objective of both projects is to practice with different machine learning methods and hyperparameter tuning/optimization (HPO). It involves the entire process: determining the best method for a dataset (model selection, including hyperparameter tuning), estimating the future performance of the best method (model evaluation), and building the final model to make predictions on new data (model usage).

## Project 1: Regression Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to use predicted meteorological variables obtained from the GFS (Global Forecast System) dataset as input attributes. This model aims to estimate the solar energy production in solar plants situated within the state of Oklahoma.

### Algorithms used
- Linear regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- XGBoost
  
## Project 2: Classification Analysis
 The topic in this project is employee attrition: a company is concerned about the level of employee attrition and would like to create a model that predicts whether employees are likely to leave the company, using a dataset collected by the human resources department.

 ### Algorithms used
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
